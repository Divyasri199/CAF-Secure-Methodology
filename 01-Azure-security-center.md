# **Exercise 1: Azure Security Center/ Microsoft Defender for Cloud**


### **Overview**

Microsoft Defender for Cloud is a Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) and Cloud Workload Protection Platform (CWPP) for all your Azure, on-premises, and multicolored (Amazon AWS and Google GCP) resources. You can find more references about the virtual network here: `https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/defender-for-cloud-introduction`

An Azure Policy definition, created in Azure Policy, is a rule about specific security conditions that you want to be controlled. Built-in definitions include things like controlling what type of resources can be deployed or enforcing the use of tags on all resources.

In this exercise, you will explore Microsoft Defender for Cloud, configuring Security Policies. Then you will fix the resources by securing the score and improving the Secure Posture. You will also explore on Security center and Security benchmark.

This exercise includes the following tasks:

  - Task 1: Exploring Microsoft Defender for Cloud
  - Task 2: Configure Security Policies
  - Task 3: Secure Score
  - Task 4: Improving your Secure Posture
  - Task 5: Exploring Security center and Security benchmark

    ![](images/defender6.png)

   > **Note**: In your environment, these numbers may not be the same, since it varies in time

1.  Notice the **total number of resources**, The total number of resources are the ones that are connected to the Microsoft Defender for Cloud and NOT the total           number of resources that you have in your subscriptions.

1. Notice the number of **unhealthy resources**, The unhealthy resources are the resources with actionable recommendations based on the selected filter.

1. Notice the **unmonitored resources**, The unmonitored resources indicate if there are resources with the Log Analytics agent deployed but with health issues. Since we      enabled the auto-provisioning in the previous module, all existing VMs are covered and connected, which means they are monitored.

1. Use the **Filter by name (1)** box to search for **Virtual machine**. You should now see a filtered view containing your desired resource: **JumpVM-<inject key="Deployment ID" enableCopy="false"/>**. Hover on the      red bar in the **recommendations** column to see a tooltip with the **active recommendations (2)**. You should expect to see **Active-xx of xx Recommendations**      these are the active recommendations you must attend.

    ![](images/editing6.png)

1. Open the resource health pane by selecting the resource. Click on **JumpVM-<inject key="Deployment ID" enableCopy="false"/> (1)**. Alternatively, you can also right-click on any resource and select **view           resource**. You may not see **view resource** directly due to different screen resolutions, then you have to click on **ellipse(...) (2)** and then select **view               resource (3)**.

    ![](images/editing7.png)

1. On the resource health pane for **JumpVM-<inject key="Deployment ID" enableCopy="false"/>**, review the virtual machine information alongside the recommendation list.

    ![](images/fix4.png)

    > **Note**: It could take up to 24 hours for all the recommendations to show up. And it is possible that during lab time this may not show up – which is the         case sometimes. If you don't see the data in the **recommendations**. You can continue to the next exercise and verify this later.

1. Go back to the Inventory page in the filter menu, select the **Resource Groups (1)** filter and then provide the value **JumpVM-rg (2)** (Unselect remaining),          and click on **Ok (3)**. Using this filter, you can see all resources related to the predefined Kubernetes resources which are monitored with active                    recommendations.
